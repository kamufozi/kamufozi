# Hey there! 👋 I'm a Software Developer from Rwanda 🇷🇼

---

## About Me 🚀

I'm a software developer passionate about turning ideas into reliable, user-friendly applications. I spend most of my time building clean interfaces, experimenting with new tools, and occasionally negotiating peace treaties with bugs (they rarely sign).

---

## What I Work With 💻

- 🎯 **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript/TypeScript
- 🎨 **Styling**: TailwindCSS (Bootstrap and I are on speaking terms)
- 🔄 **State Management**: Redux, Zustand, and the never-ending battle against prop drilling
- 🛣️ **Routing**: React Router
- ⚡ **Tooling**: VS Code, Bun (faster npm, fewer headaches).

## Currently Learning 📚

- 🌐 **Backend Development** with Node.js
- 🎯 **Next milestone**: getting comfortable with backend systems before exploring cybersecurity (because Hollywood convinced me hacking comes with cool sunglasses 😎)

---

## Other Languages 🔧

- ☕ **Java**: Explored design patterns like Strategy, Observer, Singleton (yes, I survived the debates)
- 🔤 **C**: Brushed shoulders with pointers and lived to tell the story

## Let's Connect 🤝

I'm always open to collaborating, sharing ideas, or discussing the eternal debate: tabs vs spaces.

Always happy to chat about code, trade war stories with bugs, or argue about semicolons (they’re optional, but so are feelings).
